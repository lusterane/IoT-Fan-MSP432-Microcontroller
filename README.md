## What is This?

Fun hardware project to add IoT to my home. The fan(s) will work as a mini air-conditioning unit for my room. Temperatures will be controlled wirelessly and auto-moderated to a set temperature.

  

## Boards/Modules/Materials

* MSP-EXP432P401R as host MCU

* CC3100BOOSTA for Networking

* F129025SU EverFlow CPU Fan

* Rest of the materials used were salvaged from old electronics. Resourcefulness seems key to success.
